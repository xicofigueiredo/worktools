        Dear BRAVE parents,
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong><%= @sprint_consent.hub || @hub %></strong> Hub and its learners engage in numerous activities throughout this sprint, including the community project during Build Week, as well as various park and beach activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This consent form grants permission for your child to participate in <strong>all activities</strong> organised by the <strong><%= @sprint_consent.hub || @hub %></strong> Hub and its Learning Coaches. All activities will be communicated via email and WhatsApp with advance notice, allowing parents to make informed decisions without the need to continuously sign new consent forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that no learners will be granted a “Home Day” or “Justified Absence” unless explicitly approved by the Regional Manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do not wish your child to participate in a specific activity, please send an email to the <strong><%= @sprint_consent.hub || @hub %></strong> Hub Learning Coach after being informed of the activity. This will revoke consent for that particular activity only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, if your child is unable to partake in an activity for any reason, please inform the respective Learning Coaches to prevent any confusion regarding activity planning and transport arrangements.
      </p>

        <li>There are inherent risks associated with each activity, and I willingly accept and assume all such risks that may be reasonably foreseeable to result from participating in these activities, including those specifically described by the Learning Coaches in this document or through any other means of communication.</li> <br>
        <li>I agree to inform the Learning Coaches, as appropriate, of any health issues or changes in health status that may affect or limit my participation in these activities, including, but not limited to, medications being taken, any illnesses, and any other special health-related issues.</li> <br>

        <li>Certain activities may involve the engagement of third-party companies or service providers. In this case, BGA shall not be held liable for any damages, injuries, or losses arising from the actions, omissions, or negligence of these third-party companies or their representatives, as BGA acts solely as an intermediary in facilitating the arrangement of these activities and does not have direct control over the operations, safety measures, or quality of services provided by these third-party companies.</li> <br>

In the event of cancellation, the school will endeavor to offer a suitable alternative activity</li> <br>
        <li>Cancellations by the Learner must be communicated to the Learning Coach, providing the reason, prior to its scheduled date. In the event of a cancellation, no refunds will be provided as reservations and commitments have already been made with the visited locations and/or transportation providers.</li> <br>

It is important for the safety and well-being of all participants that learners remain under supervision and guidance throughout the entire activity.</li> <br>
        <li>BGA has taken reasonable measures to ensure the safety and well-being of the participants during Build Week. In consideration agreeing to participate in the activity, I hereby release, indemnify, and hold harmless BGA, its officers, employees, and agents from any and all claims, demands, actions, or causes of action arising out of or resulting from my participation in the activity, including, without limitation, personal injury or property damage, except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or intentional misconduct of BGA, its officers, employees, and agents.</li> <br>
