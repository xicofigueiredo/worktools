            The dates for the mock exams will be chosen by the learners based on their course completion goals.

            In order to take the mock exams, learners must complete certain assignments as determined by the course manager (CM). Once these assignments have been completed, learners may submit a request to take the mock exams.

            The following table provides more information about the learners' exam series and the expectations for completing the mocks. It is important that learners take the mock exams seriously as they will provide valuable feedback on their progress and highlight areas that may need further attention."></i>
